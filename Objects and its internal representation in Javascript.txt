
Objects :

Objects are important data types in Javascript

Objects are different than primitive datatypes(Number,string,boolean)

Primitive datatypes contain one value but object can hold many values in form of key value pair

These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively in the context 
of an object


Object properties :

Every object has some property associated with some value

These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them

Eg.
  var mybike = new object();
  mybike.name = "pulsar";

  Input : mybike.name
  Output : pulsar


Object methods :

An Object method is an object property containing a Function definition

Methods are actions that can be performed on Objects


Object Literal :

Data type used to define objects in Javascript

It is a syntax for creating an object in Javascript that is composed of key-value pairs

Properities and values Inside the curly braces are known as object Literal


Object with Constructor :
 
Constructor is nothing but a function and with the help of new keyword

Constructor Function allows to create multiplr objects of same flavor


Object.Create() method :

Objects can be created using the object.create() method

This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want
to create, without having to define a constructor function.


Object using New keyword :

Creates a new object with new keyword

Eg.
   var person = new object();
   person.firstname = "Valliyappan";
   person.lastname = "Ram";
   person.age = "28";
