
HTTP/1.1

It works on textual format

There is a head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources

It uses requests resource Inline for getting multiple pages

It compresses data by itself

No Control over prioritization

It affects web pages load time

Most of the pages load at once if these render-blocking resources load last


HTTP/2

It works on binary format

It allows multiplexing So one TCP connection is required for multiple requests

It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages

PUSH Works over HTTP/2 is frames protocol. Information is exchanged in group of bytes called frames.

If a client requests a web page, the server may PUSH dependent stylesheets,fonts and images to the client

It compresses data using HPACK. HPACK is nothing but a format adapted to efficiently represent HTTP headers
the context of HTTP/2

Control over prioritization

Doesn't affect web pages load speed. 

This allows developers to decide which page resource load first, every time.
